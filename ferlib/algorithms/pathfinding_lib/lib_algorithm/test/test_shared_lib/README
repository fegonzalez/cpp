@warning Required: the library must exists => execute 'make shlib' on the
	 source code (i.e. cd ../.. && make shlib).



# Individually, 

  # Run tests:

    make run.directed_iface_test
    make run.undirected_iface_test


  # Diff tests: check validation after any code changes.

    make diff.directed_iface_test
    make diff.undirected_iface_test



# Size of the binaries:

  - Using the dynamic (shared) library: 

    directed_iface_test:   32 K
    undirected_iface_test: 32 K
 

  - Using the static library: 

    directed_iface_test:   106 K
    undirected_iface_test: 106 K
