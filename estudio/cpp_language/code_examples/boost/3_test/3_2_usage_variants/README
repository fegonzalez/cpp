  [doc_1] ../../../../concrete_topics/boost.howto  3.2 Usage Varianst


[doc_1] 3.2.1 Single-header usage variant (a.k.a. the included version)

  See ../3_1_basic/ example


[doc_1] 3.2.2 Static library usage variant

  \warning Customizing the module's entry point (*) will affect
   everybody else who is linking against the library. It may be less
   intrusive to switch to the shared library usage variant instead.

   (See http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/
   	/adv_scenarios/static_lib_customizations.html for details.)


   Therefore, this is not tested here.
