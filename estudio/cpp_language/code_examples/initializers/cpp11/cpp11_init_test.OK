Test a2) a braced-init-list is used in list-initialization
constructed with a 5-element list
The vector size is now 5 ints:
The vector size is now 8 ints:

Test a1) a braced-init-list is bound to auto,  including in a ranged for loop:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
Range-for over brace-init-list: 
-1 -2 -3 
The list bound to auto has size() = 3
